`第一篇是写推荐信 ：优秀范文赏析`

```
Der jane:
  
    i'm so glad to hear from you as it has been a long time since we met last time.
    You told me in your letter that you loved to watch insprational（给与启迪的） movies,
    so i'm writing to recommend one of my favoite movies to you,
    which is called The Devil Wears Rrada.
    
    i love it for two reasons .
    To begin with ,the film explores the theme of growth and self-discovery（自我发现） in the workplace,
    which could easily 【strike a chord with】（引起 ... 共鸣） young people.
    The aspirant（有抱负的） heroine undergoes（经历） an 'ugly duckling - swan'（丑小鸭变成白天鹅）phase in the workplace and finally
    returns to her initial ideal, inspiring us to be true to ourselves.
    
    In addition  , the grammour of fashion industry also adds appeal to the film 
    
    Hope you enjoy the moive and look forward to your reply
    
                                                                   
                                                                      Yours truly
                                                                         Li  Ming

`第二篇是写 环境 保护的 `

```
      In the picture , two tourists ,enjoying a delightful boat trip on the lake,
  are dropping litter recklessly(不在意的) into the lake 
  -- a behavior that  makes themseleves as well as the scenery not beautiful at all.
  And unfortunately , the lake is already littered with a clutter of garbage,
  which has spoiled the perviously scenic lake.
  Just as the caption" What 's Left  after the Travel implies , " the cartoon is a poignant
  aciticism of tourists with uncivil conducts that lead to environmental damage.
  
      What is reflected in the picture is troubling many scenic spots today.
  Such behavior comes primarily from tourists ' lack of environmental awareness, 
  thinking of just casually littering garbage as no big deal .
  They regard themselves merely as passers-by , who need not assume the responsibility of
  protecting the environment of  the  scenicspots.
  
      However , if everyone lacked  environmental awareness ,standing by and seeing envirnoment hurt,
  the beautiful spots , even our whole country , would be swallowed up by rubbish one day.
  
  
      To avoid this kind of tragedy ,the whold society should tack action to protect our home.
  For one thing  ,everyone should realize the importance of protectint the environment and start 
  small by no littering at will and stopping others from doing that timely .
  For another , relevant authorities should establish sound and efficient laws and regulations on 
  environmental protection ,supervise effectively and punish law breakers severely .
  
      Hopefully through  shared efforts , we can make ourselves behave better ,make the landscape of
  our homeland more mangificent , and fulfill the dream of "green China" sonnor.
